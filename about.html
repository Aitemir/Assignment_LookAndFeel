                The NHDC website developers are Aitemir Yeskenov and Zicheng Xiao.
                Both are current graduate students at the University of South Florida
                pursuing degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems. For this project the
                team decided to create a set of HTML&CSS-based webpages that allow to
                submit survey on customer satisfaction and help patients that fight cancer in the U.S.
                Yeskenov and Xiao used CDN links for the look of the buttons, icons,
                cards and other elements from the Google Material design library that is available
                on the Internet.

            Aitemir contributed to this project by applying his web-development knowledge. At his previous
            job he used Angular framework built by Google to create front-end applications. Despite the fact that
            Angular's HTML code looks way different in the final product, in this version for the assignment 3, he
            implemented the look and feel by using the CDN to the Google's CSS so as to mimic the interface and
            make it look in the Google Material style. He also populated the tables on both pages with hardcoded data.
            Aitemir's main contribution is about designing the first page and application of the Google Material library.

            Zicheng contributed a lot to the NHDC project. His main contribution was to design the layout of the
            future application. Zicheng was in charge of the second tab - page "Survey" and built the form field such
            as first name, last name, age, sex, location, and satisfaction flag HTML elements as well as the submit button.
            He also wrote description for the third page. Yeskenov and Zicheng both designed the future database tables and
            implemented hard coded version of the data for the assignment 3.

            <p>
                At this point the database has three tables and will soon be ready to interact with the back-end and
                front-end pieces of software. <a href="https://github.com/aitemir/assignment_lookandfeel"> Github Link</a>
